# Welcome in my coding zone !

Hello it's me ! Yes this little thing !

<img alt="Octopuss attack" src="https://github.com/SwiftySkull/SwiftySkull/blob/main/Seiche-79526.gif?raw=true" width="100%">

## Who am I ? 🐙

I'm a FullStack Web Developer who especially works with React and Symfony.
I love playing with CSS even though my imagination is not my main asset..!

## My work 🖥️

<a href="https://www.developoulpe.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferre noopener">DeveloPoulpe</a> is my "brand name" and here you can visit my new website where you'll be able to find my career and the projects I worked on !

You'll also have all my links on it if you want to know me better or reach out to me in a way or an other ! 🔗

## My goals ✔️

Actually I'm looking for new clients 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 OR a company who would like to adopt a motivated little octopus 🐙 !
Mainly I prefer working at home, I made myself a good space with good material to work (<strong>Cooler Master family</strong>) , and the best interest : I have a bigger working time if I work at home, I could code all night long ! 🌜

## Let's stay in touch 📝

If you want to reach out to me then you have many possibilities :
- Going on my <a href="https://www.developoulpe.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferre noopener">website</a> and sending me a message from there !
- Sending me an email to : <a mailto="aurelien.beneyton@developoulpe.fr">aurelien.beneyton@developoulpe.fr</a>
- Going on social media maybe :
   - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aurelien-b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferre noopener">LinkedIn</a>
   - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/swiftyskull/" target="_blank" rel="noreferre noopener">Instagram</a>

The easiest way is from my website anyway !

🌞
If you need anything, just ask me ! I may have a free arm out of 8 to write you back and help you !

Enjoy diving into the sea ! 🌊 🌊
